Place your real resume PDF here and name it exactly `Indumathi_Madhu_Resume.pdf` so the site Resume button can open it in the modal.

To copy from your Desktop (macOS example):

cp "~/Desktop/Indu_Portfolio/Indumathi_Madhu_Resume.pdf" ./assets/Indumathi_Madhu_Resume.pdf

Or drag-and-drop the file into this `assets/` folder in Finder.
